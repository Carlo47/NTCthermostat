# NTCthermostat
Shows how to realize a thermostat with a NTC resistor

Maybe you also have some of these strange components in your tinkering box, 
which you removed from a defective battery pack or an old PC power supply. 
These are NTC resistors, i.e. resistors with a negative temperature 
coefficient. Their resistance therefore decreases with increasing temperature. 
They are suitable for temperature measurement or, as the title of this project 
says, for building a thermostat.

## Some Formulas
If we connect an NTC resistor in series with another resistor whose value we 
know, we can measure the voltage at this voltage divider and calculate the 
unknown resistance value of the NTC from it. We can set up the voltage divider 
in two different ways, namely connect the NTC to ground or to Vcc. 
```
  ---+-- Vcc                            ---+--- Vcc
     |                                     |
    .-.                                   .-. 
    | | Rs                                |\| NTC
    '-'                                   '-' 
     |                                     | 
     +---> analog input                    +---> analog input
     |                                     |   
    .-.                                   .-.
    |\| NTC                               | | Rs
    '-'                                   '-'
     |                                     |
  ---+--- GND                           ---+--- GND
```
If we assume that the ADC (analog to digital converter) of our microcontroller 
delivers the value Aval between 0 and Amax (e.g. 0..1023), for input voltages 
from 0V to Vcc , the resistance of the NTC for the two cases is calculated as 
follows: 
```
  Rt = Rs * Aval / (Amax - Aval         Rt = Rs * (Amax - Aval) / Aval
    or with                               or with
  k = (Amax -Aval) / Aval               k = (Amax -Aval) / Aval 
    = Amax/Aval - 1                       = Amax/Aval - 1
    we get                                we get
  Rt = Rs * 1/k (NTC to GND)            Rt = Rs * k (NTC to Vcc)
```
Now we know the resistance of the NTC. But how do we calculate the temperature 
from this? The formula of Steinhart-Hart helps us here: 
```
  R(T) = Ro * exp(BETA * (1/T - 1/To)  Steinhartâ€“Hart equation
  ===================================  
  To     Nominal temperature, normally 25Â°C ðŸš© for calculations use degrees Kelvin ðŸš©
  Ro     Resistance of the NTC resistor at nominal temperature R(To)
 
  Roo  = Ro * exp(-BETA / To)          Resistance for T --> oo

  Rt   = Roo * exp(BETA / T)           Resistance at temperature T
  
  T    = BETA / ln(Rt / Roo)           Temperature as a function of measured resistance
```
In the Steinhart-Hart equation BETA denotes the characteristic parameter of the NTC. 
It can be taken from the data sheet of the NTC or calculated from 2 resistance 
measurements at different temperatures: 
```
         T2 * T1
  BETA = ------- * ln(R1 / R2)         R1, R2 measured resitance values at 
         T2 - T1                       two different temperatures T1, T2	
```
